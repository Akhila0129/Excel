# Excel
In this project, I explored a variety of Excel functionalities to enhance data analysis and visualization. I implemented conditional formatting to highlight key data trends, applied Excel charts to visually represent data patterns, and utilized advanced formulas for more efficient calculations. Additionally, I worked with XLOOKUP and VLOOKUP functions to perform complex data lookups and retrievals, streamlining the process of cross-referencing large datasets. This project demonstrates my ability to leverage Excel's powerful features to organize, analyze, and present data effectively.
